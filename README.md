### Project Description

#### 1. Data Collection
The first stage of the project involved collecting data from the ChEMBL database, with a focus on "Proteases." These enzymes play essential roles in various biological processes and are particularly relevant in the context of diseases such as coronavirus. Because of their therapeutic importance, proteases were chosen as the target for this analysis. The collected data formed the basis for all subsequent steps in the project.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
Once the data was collected, it was carefully preprocessed to make it suitable for further analysis. The preprocessing phase included:

- Cleaning the dataset by addressing missing values and resolving inconsistencies.
- Transforming the data to ensure it was in a structured and standardized format.
- Organizing the features to prepare the data for machine learning models.

This step was crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
To understand the data better, exploratory data analysis was carried out. This involved:

- Using visual tools to examine distributions, patterns, and trends within the dataset.
- Analyzing correlations between different variables to identify significant relationships.
- Employing visualizations, such as plots and graphs, to make the data more comprehensible.

This phase provided valuable insights that guided subsequent decisions in the project.

#### 4. Feature Selection
The next step was to select the most relevant features for the machine learning models. The focus was on identifying attributes that had the most predictive power while removing redundant or irrelevant ones. This step streamlined the dataset and ensured that the modeling process was both efficient and effective.

#### 5. Modeling and Evaluation
Finally, machine learning models were developed to make predictions based on the processed data. Multiple algorithms were used, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regression, among others. Each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). The performance of the models was compared to select the one that provided the most accurate and reliable predictions.

This structured approach ensured that the project yielded meaningful insights and robust results.
